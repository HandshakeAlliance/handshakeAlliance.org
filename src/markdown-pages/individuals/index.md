An experimental peer-to-peer root naming system

<HorizontalRule borderWidth={2} />

## Handshake is more than another blockchain

Handshake aims to improve upon the current domain name system. It does not replace our current DNS, but instead replaces the current root zone with a decentralized blockchain.

Every peer in the network is responsible for validating and managing the root zone, a task currently reserved for certificate authorities. Name proofs are stored on the Handshake blockchain and open to everyone versus the currrent root zone controlled by ICANN.

All entries in ICANN's existing root zone file are reserved. Also, names in the list of Alexa top 100,000 domains are also reserved for further inclusion of existing stakeholders. If the names are not claimed on the Handshake network, it will fallback to traditional resolvers.

## The Handshake Coin

The Handshake blockchain uses a token native to the blockchain referred to as HNS. It is used to register top level domains which are pinned to a specific certificate as the identity on the Handshake blockchain. When a name is auctioned and sold, the coins are destroyed from the system. This creates a cost to owning a name, making it expensive to spam the network and own the majority of names

## Earn HNS

The majority of HNS was gifted to free and open-source software (FOSS) developers.

Note: these are the only recommended methods of claiming your airdrop. Other methods exist, but use them at your own risk

You may have an airdrop waiting for you if any of the criteria below is met:

  > * Anyone who had more than 15 followers on Github, and also had valid SSH+PGP keys on their GitHub account, during the week of February 4th, 2019 (roughly 170,000 accounts)
  > * People whose PGP keys are included in the WOT Strongset (30,000 keys)
  > * Hacker News accounts older than 1.5 years old with linked Keybase accounts (about 19,000 accounts) 

Every open source developer on the final mainnet list will receive 4,246.994314 HNS

## Top Level Domains (TLDs)

A top level domain (TLD) refers to the last segment of a domain name or part that follows immediately after the “dot” symbol. A TLD is at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Naming System (DNS). Here are some popular TLD’s you are most likely familiar with:

  > * .com
  > * .org
  > * .edu
  > * .gov
  > * .biz

## Handshake Wallets

A Handshake wallet allows you to receive and spend HNS, place bids on names and update resource records for your names. There are a few options for creating a Handshake wallet:

  > * Command Line CLI - <a style={{ color: "var(--color-primary)" }} href="https://hsd-dev.org/guides/wallet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hs-client</a>
  > * GUI - <a style={{ color: "var(--color-primary)" }} href="https://github.com/kyokan/bob-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Wallet</a>
  

Note: this will require some technical knowledge, check out the handshake community support channels for help. Never tell anyone your keys or mnemonic phrase.
